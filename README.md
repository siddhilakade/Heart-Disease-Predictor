Heart Disease Predictor
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of clinical and demographic features. The project uses a Random Forest Classifier model trained on a heart disease dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a predictive model that can classify whether a patient has heart disease. This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including:

Data Acquisition and Exploration: Downloading a dataset from Kaggle, and performing an initial analysis to understand the data structure and identify missing values.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Training and Evaluation: Training a Logistic Regression and Random Forest model, and evaluating their performance using accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Model Deployment Preparation: Saving the trained model and the feature scaler for future use.

Prediction on New Data: Providing a script to load the saved model and scaler to make predictions on new, user-provided data.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features, such as:

age: Age of the patient.

sex: Gender of the patient.

cp: Chest pain type.

trestbps: Resting blood pressure.

chol: Serum cholesterol.

thalch: Maximum heart rate achieved.

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.

thal: Thallium stress test result.

num: The target variable, indicating the presence of heart disease (0 = no disease, >0 = disease).

Getting Started
To run this project, you can use Google Colab or a local Python environment.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib, kaggle.

Installation
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib kaggle

Usage
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/siddhilakade/Heart-Disease-Predictor.git
cd Heart-Disease-Predictor

Run the Notebook: Open the Heart_Disease_Predictor.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or your preferred Jupyter environment. Run all the cells to train the model, evaluate it, and save the necessary files.

Make Predictions: You can make predictions on new data by providing a CSV file with the same features as the training data. The notebook includes a final section that guides you through uploading your own data and getting predictions. The output will be a table that shows the prediction for each record.

Results
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 84%.

Random Forest: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 60%.

The Logistic Regression model performed better on this dataset. The notebook also includes visualizations, such as a correlation heatmap and a confusion matrix, to provide a deeper understanding of the data and model performance.

Feature Importance
A feature importance chart generated by the Random Forest model is included to highlight the most influential features for prediction. This gives insights into which variables have the strongest impact on the model's decision-making process.
